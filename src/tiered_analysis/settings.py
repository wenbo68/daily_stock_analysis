"""User sizing settings for tiered analysis (v2 slice 6).

Sizing is opt-in: the share formula only runs when the user has said how
much capital they trade with and what fraction of it they accept losing
on one trade. The values live in the product's existing settings
mechanism — ``.env`` keys, editable from the web settings page — and
absent settings keep v1 behavior (no share counts, ever).

Parsing is fail-loud: a malformed value never silently becomes a number;
it is dropped with a warning and sizing stays off (a missing number is
safer than a fake one).
