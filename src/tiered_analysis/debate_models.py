"""Pydantic forms the tier-2 debate (v8) forces its LLM calls to fill.

Every stage of the debate (two analyst lists, the merge match-map, the
check round, the deciding round, citation fixes) is a strict typed form,
not free prose: the engine hands the model the exact JSON shape,
validates the reply against these models, retries once with the
validation errors shown, and degrades/voids per the failure rules if the
retry is still invalid.

v12 (owner spec 2026-07-31): the opening stage is a GRADE SHEET, not a
free-form list. Code enumerates every gradable report field; each
analyst must return exactly one grade per field (bullish / bearish /
neutral) — ``check_grade_sheet`` rejects a reply that skips a field,
invents one, or grades one twice, so "each field is used once" is
enforced structurally, not by prompt. Code converts non-neutral grades
into evidence bullets (ids assigned by code in field order) and matches
the two analysts' sheets by field — no merge LLM call. Every bullet's
author is its first valid vote (a field both analysts graded the same
direction is confirmed 2-0 on the spot); a check round casts the second
vote on single-author bullets; a deciding round breaks 1-1 ties.
Citations are code's job alone — links are ``{ref, value}`` and every
link, including the ones inside vote reasons, is verified mechanically
with a fix loop. Structural rules that depend on run-time data live in
the validator helpers at the bottom — they raise ``ValueError`` with
retry-friendly messages.
