"""Log tier reports into DSA's existing decision-signal system (slice 6).

DSA already has the recommendation log the design doc asked for: the
``decision_signals`` table (every recommendation with entry/stop/target),
the outcome job that fetches the subsequent price path
(``decision_signal_outcome_service``), and a web page that renders each
signal's ``data_quality_summary``. Building a parallel log would violate
the repo's reuse rule — so this module is a thin CLIENT adapter:

- ``build_signal_payload``: pure mapping TierReport -> service payload.
  Coverage badges ride in ``data_quality_summary`` (overall level plus a
  per-dimension map); the existing signals page displays them as-is.
- ``log_tier_report``: submits via ``DecisionSignalService`` (injected in
  tests). Logging must never crash an analysis run — failures come back
  as a structured ``SignalLogResult`` with the reason, not an exception.

Boundary note: this imports DSA services as a client, same as Tier1Stage
consumes DSA analysis results. It does not modify the decision path.
