"""AI plan review (owner redesign 2026-07-22; check-adjust cycle same day).

The old display-only risk card is gone; its deterministic checks now do
something:

- **Adjustable checks** — liquidity (order > 5% of the average daily
  volume), volatility (typical daily swing > 4% of price) and
  stop-vs-support (stop resting at/above the nearest pivot low) feed an
  LLM call that may adjust the plan: trim the share count, move the
  stop, move the target. Every accepted adjustment carries a
  code-validated, link-cited reason (the same citation contract as the
  tier-2 debate).
- **The cycle** — an adjusted plan can trip a check the computed plan
  did not (a tightened stop raises the mechanical share count past the
  liquidity limit), so the PLAN-DEPENDENT checks (liquidity, stop vs
  support) re-run after every adjustment round, up to
  ``MAX_ADJUST_ROUNDS`` rounds. Volatility depends only on report data —
  no adjustment can change it — so it fires in round 1 as context and
  never counts against convergence. Converged (no plan-dependent check
  fires) → the cumulative adjustments stand. Not converged → every
  adjustment is discarded, the computed plan stands, and
  ``levels_detail["review_failures"]`` records what failed per round.
- **Warning checks** — the two overnight-gap scenarios and a
  reward-to-risk shortfall become structured per-column warnings on the
  trade-plan card. The backend ships numbers only; the frontend words
  them.

Everything degrades loudly: no LLM, unparseable reply, invalid links →
the computed plan stands and a warning says why.
