"""Run gating for tiered analysis (owner decisions 2026-08-08).

Two gates keep every tiered run anchored on completed daily bars:

- The CLOCK gate (interactive runs): a run is rejected from market open
  until ``RUN_BUFFER_MINUTES`` past the close, in the exchange's own
  timezone. Weekends and pre-open mornings are allowed; holidays are only
  known when exchange-calendars is installed (without it a holiday
  daytime is a false block — accepted for now). The web popup offers a
  "run anyway" override, which the API honors.
- The STALENESS gate (all runs, enforced inside the pipeline): after the
  bars are fetched and BEFORE any LLM call, the run stops when the
  newest completed bar is older than the most recent completed trading
  session. Stopped runs show ``Outlook.STOPPED`` and nothing else; the
  reason lives in logs only. There is deliberately NO override here — a
  clock-gate "run anyway" during the trading day expects YESTERDAY's bar
  and passes; only a genuinely lagging vendor stops a run.

Calendar duty is delegated to ``src.core.trading_calendar``
(exchange-calendars under the hood). Without that library the clock gate
fails OPEN (a run is never blocked on a guess) and the expected-session
calculation falls back to weekday arithmetic over fixed session times —
the constants below are that fallback only, never the primary source.
