"""Tier 2: the evidence vote (v12 — graded sheet).

v12 revision (owner spec 2026-07-31, replacing the v8-v11 free-form
lists): the opening stage is a GRADE SHEET. Code enumerates every
gradable report field (each non-blank leaf, in report order) and each
of the two blind ANALYSTS must return exactly one grade per field —
bullish, bearish or neutral. The one-grade-per-field rule is enforced
structurally (``check_grade_sheet`` rejects a reply that skips, invents
or double-grades a field; JSON object keys make a double grade
impossible to express), not by prompt wording. Code converts the
non-neutral grades into evidence bullets — ids assigned by code in
field order, the graded field's citation injected by code with the
exact display value — and MATCHES the two sheets by field in pure code
(same field + same direction = the same bullet; an opposite-direction
clash is a dispute and stays unmatched). The old merge LLM call is
gone. Membership is a majority vote with at most three votes per
bullet:

- A bullet's author is automatically its first valid vote, so a bullet
  BOTH analysts listed independently starts 2-0 — confirmed, no checking.
- A CHECK round casts the second vote on every single-author bullet:
  2-0 confirmed or 1-1 tied.
- A DECIDING round breaks the ties: 2-1 in or 1-2 out. Three votes,
  so a tie is impossible.

Citations are code's job alone (carried over from v7): links are
``{ref, value}`` with the value copied exactly as the report pages
display it (``display_value``).
Code verifies every link — including the links inside vote reasons —
and sends failures back to the same AI in up to ``MAX_FIX_ROUNDS``
focused fix calls; bullets that cannot be fixed are STRUCK (crossed
out, never voted on, in no pool) and unfixable votes are discarded.

NO AI authors any number, but every voter RATES each bullet's
importance 1-5 (v11 owner spec, 2026-07-20: 1 = very minor, 3 = normal
evidence, 5 = very important — thesis-changing) and gives one short
plain sentence saying why (``weight_reason``, shown in the UI's check
modals). Listers rate their own bullets in the same call; check/decider
votes carry a weight alongside the verdict. A bullet's final weight is
the MEDIAN of its voters' weights (two voters → their mean, so halves
happen). The outlook score is computed by code from the direction tags
and the weights:
``10 × Σweight(bullish) / Σweight(all)`` over the whole pool
(per-dimension counts and weight sums are stored for the section
headers). Two snapshots: initial (the merged list before voting,
weighted by the authors' own ratings, stored for the audit trail only)
and final (the bullets the votes left standing, weighted by the full
voter median — the displayed score). Verdict on the 2-decimal final:
< 4 sell, 4-6 hold, > 6 buy. Empty final pool → 5.00, hold, warning.

4-5 base LLM calls (two grade sheets parallel with their fix loops →
code merge → check round → deciding round only when there are ties →
summary), all temperature 0. Every stage fills a strict Pydantic form;
an invalid reply gets ONE retry with the errors shown, then: both
sheets failing voids the tier-2 verdict (tier-1 direction stands); one
sheet failing proceeds with the other; a failed check round counts
bullets on their author's vote alone; a failed deciding round excludes
the tied bullets as unresolved; the summary's failure never voids
anything.

  a neutral grade needs no other keys and produces no evidence.
- A bullish/bearish grade carries "claim": ONE plain sentence stating
